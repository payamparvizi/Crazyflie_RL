# Reinforcement Learning on Crazyflie 2.1

## Overview 

This code implements the PPO algorithm for the Crazyflie 2.1 drone. It includes both a simulated environment and a real-world setup for training the PPO algorithm to control the Crazyflie 2.1 to hover at a specific altitude. The figure of the Crazyflie 2.1 is shown below:
